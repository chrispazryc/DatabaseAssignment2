-- File Description:
-- This file queries the database for a variety of information.

-- 1. A simple query that pulls all columns and rows from a table 
select 	* 
from 	customer;

-- 2. A query that displays a subset of columns 
select  product_description         AS "Product",  
        product_inventory_quantity  AS "Number in Inventory" 
from product;

-- 3. A query that displays a subset of columns with a single clause (predicate) WHERE statement 
select 	line_number           AS "Line", 
	product_product_code  AS "Product Code", 
	quantity_fulfilled    AS "Quantity Fulfilled", 
        orders_orders_id      AS "Order Number" 
from line_item 
where orders_orders_id = 2;

-- 4. A query that displays a subset of columns with a multi-clause (predicate) WHERE statement using AND/OR 
select 	orders_id   		AS "Order ID",
	orders_date 		AS "Date of Order",
        customer_customer_id 	AS "Cusotmer ID"
from orders
where 		customer_customer_id = 1 
	OR 	customer_customer_id = 4;

-- 5. A query that performs a single table join. In other words, you are joining 2 tables. 
SELECT 	*
FROM 	parts, parts_has_product
where 	parts.parts_number = parts_has_product.parts_parts_number;

-- 6. A query that performs a multi-table join. In other words, you are joining 3 or more tables. 
SELECT 	parts.parts_description 	AS "Part",
	product.product_description	AS "Product",
        parts_inventory_quantity 	AS "Part Quantity",
        product_inventory_quantity 	AS "Product Quantity"
FROM 	parts, 
	parts_has_product, 
	product
where 		parts.parts_number 	= parts_has_product.parts_parts_number 
	AND	product.product_code 	= parts_has_product.product_product_code;

-- 7. A query that performs an aggregate (count, min, max, sum, avg, etc.). 
select 	sum(product_inventory_quantity) AS "Total Inventory"
from	product;

-- 8. A query that performs an aggregate (count, min, max, sum, avg, etc.) with a GROUP BY. 
select		product_product_code 		AS "Product Code",
		count(parts_parts_number) 	AS "Number of parts"
from	 	parts_has_product
group by 	product_product_code;

-- 9. A query that performs an aggregate (count, min, max, sum, avg, etc.). with a GROUP BY and a HAVING clause 
select		product_product_code 		AS "Product Code",
		count(parts_parts_number) 	AS "Number of parts"
from	 	parts_has_product
group by 	product_product_code
having		count(parts_parts_number) > 1;

-- 10. A query that performs a subquery either as part of the WHERE clause or as a derived/virtual table. 

-- 11. A query that performs an aggregate with a join and a group by.
select		product.product_description		AS "Product Name",
		count(parts.parts_number) 		AS "Number of Parts"
from	 	product 
			join parts_has_product
				on product.product_code = parts_has_product.product_product_code
					join parts
						on parts_has_product.parts_parts_number = parts.parts_number
group by 	product_product_code;
